# Full-Stack MERN Authentication Application

Welcome to the Full-Stack MERN Authentication Application project! 

## Project Overview

This project showcases a MERN stack application with secure authentication capabilities leveraging the latest versions of React, MongoDB, Node.js, and Express to build a dynamic web app that includes:

- **Frontend Setup**: Install React.js and Tailwind CSS. Utilize React Router Dom for routing and create authentication pages to lay the groundwork for a feature-rich application.
- **Authentication**: Implement secure email/password authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and integrate Google OAuth for seamless sign-ins.
- **State Management**: Use Redux Toolkit for efficient state management and maintain global states effortlessly.
- **Profile Pages**: Secure profile pages with both client-side and backend protections. Update profiles, including image uploads via Firebase Storage.
- **Account Deletion**: Safely delete user accounts with JWT cookie checks.
- **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations with MongoDB for effective database interaction.
- **Deployment**: Deploy your full-stack app for free using Render and share it with others or add it to your portfolio.
